This module provides a simplified interface. If you want more, see "Test.Tasty.Golden.Advanced".

Note about filenames. They are looked up in the usual way, thus relative
names are relative to the processes current working directory.
It is common to run tests from the package's root directory (via @cabal
test@ or @cabal install --enable-tests@), so if your test files are under
the @tests\/@ subdirectory, your relative file names should start with
@tests\/@ (even if your @test.hs@ is itself under @tests\/@, too).

Note about line endings. The best way to avoid headaches with line endings
(when running tests both on UNIX and Windows) is to treat your golden files
as binary, even when they are actually textual.

This means:

* When writing output files from Haskell code, open them in binary mode
(see 'openBinaryFile', 'withBinaryFile' and 'hSetBinaryMode'). This will
disable automatic @\\n -> \\r\\n@ conversion on Windows. For convenience, this
module exports 'writeBinaryFile' which is just like `writeFile` but opens
the file in binary mode. When using 'ByteString's note that
"Data.ByteString" and "Data.ByteString.Lazy" use binary mode for
@writeFile@, while "Data.ByteString.Char8" and "Data.ByteString.Lazy.Char8"
use text mode.

* Tell your VCS not to do any newline conversion for golden files. For
 git check in a @.gitattributes@ file with the following contents (assuming
 your golden files have @.golden@ extension):

>*.golden	-text

On its side, tasty-golden reads and writes files in binary mode, too.

Why not let Haskell/git do automatic conversion on Windows? Well, for
instance, @tar@ will not do the conversion for you when unpacking a release
tarball, so when you run @cabal install your-package --enable-tests@, the
tests will be broken.

As a last resort, you can strip all @\\r@s from both arguments in your
comparison function when necessary. But most of the time treating the files
as binary does the job.
