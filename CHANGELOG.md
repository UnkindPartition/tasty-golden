Intercept exceptions thrown by the test, adhering to the new tasty API
contract.

---------------

Switch from temporary-rc to temporary

Version 2.3.0.1
---------------

Impose a lower bound version constraint on bytestring.

Version 2.3
-----------

* Accepting tests is no longer done by a separate ingredient; instead it is now
  an option that affects tests themselves.
    * `--accept` used to run only golden tests; now all tests are run, but only
      golden tests are affected by this option
    * when accepting, all the usual options apply (such as `-j`)
    * when accepting, the interace is the same as when running
    * `defaultMain` and `acceptingTests` are kept for compatibility, but do not
      do anything and are obsolete
* When a golden test file does not exist, it is created automatically, even when
  `--accept` is not specified. You'll see a message like

        UnboxedTuples:                 OK (0.04s)
          Golden file did not exist; created

* No longer use lazy IO
    * `ValueGetter` type is gone (replaced by `IO`)
    * Because of that, the type of the primitive `goldenTest` is changed
    * `vgReadFile` function is gone (replaced by `Data.ByteString.readFile`)
